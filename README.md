Expectations
Code should be Demo-able and functionally complete.
Code should fail gracefully with a proper error message for corner/invalid cases, use exceptions for handling these cases.
Code should be modular, try thinking in terms of Object-Oriented Design.
Input can be taken from the command line or in the main function.
Do not use any database or NoSQL store, use in-memory data structure.
Do not create any UI for the application
Driver class can be designed as per your choice, but it should cover all the scenarios.
Please prioritise code compilation, execution, and completion.
Work on the expected output first and then only work on bonus features.
